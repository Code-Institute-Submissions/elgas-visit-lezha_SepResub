- ### Design
   - #### Colour Scheme
      - Since the website contains a lot of pictures and a large video, everything else is white with contrasting black font colour.
   - #### Imagery
      - The large video is the main attraction for the website, since it is enagaging and it will give a quick overview of what the city is about and its main attractions. Videos are the most used form for getting information so that will deliver that to our users. The rest of the website is designed as small displays cards with short information and to draw the user to get more information from the guide at the end.
