## User Experience (UX)

### User stories

    * First Time Visitor Goals
        a. As a first time visitor, the website should feel light and easy to grasp. It should give the 
        right information quickly. 
        b. The website should be easily scrollable on the phone, and fun to navigate.
        c. It should convey the right information in a simple and engaging way.
    
    * Returning Visitor Goals
        a. As a returning visitor, I might be looking for an idea on what to do in the city.
        b. Returning visitors, will want to get an updated tourist guide.
    

### Design

    * Colour Scheme : Since the website contains a lot of pictures and a large video, everything else is
     white with contrasting black font colour.

    * Imagery: The large video is the main attraction for the website, since 
    its enagaging and it will give a quick overview of what the city is about. 
    Videos are the most used form for getting information. The rest of the website 
    is designed as small displays cards with short information in order to draw 
    the user to get more information from the guide at the end.

## Wireframes
    
Used balsamiq wireframe for the initial design ideas. See here: ![Balsamiq](balsamiq.png)

        -The video and images make it appealing and enjoyable.
        -The user has the option to enter first and last name, email, 
        select a language and get a free guide.

    * Further Testing
        - The website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and 
        on these devices desktop, laptop, iPhone5, Huawei P20 Pro.
        - Rigorous testing was done for all the internal and external 
        links that the site contains.
        - Friends and family members were asked to visit the site and 
        give feedback on their experience.
        - Checked all alternative text for all the image element.
        - Tested the uploading speed (result 1.4 s)of the website 
        since it is important for a good UX, and Google rankings.

    * Fixed bugs
        - Bootstrap was used in order to make the website responsive, 
        but all the images that the website contains had to be fixed 
        by using CSS media queries, for four breaking points. Before 
        adding the necessary fixes, the images had different sizes while 
        moving through the screen breakpoints.
        - The collapsable menu was covering the content in small screen divices, 
        fixed by deactivating it when the screen is smaller.
